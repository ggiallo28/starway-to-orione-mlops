# Starway to Orione CUDA (Cloud Utilities and Data Analytics) - TEAM

DoAI is the **D**evelopment **O**peration and **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence

This is the learning path every new Cloud Data Architect has to follow when joining the XPeppers Cloud team.
This path reflects our team's culture and values, which have their roots in the [agile values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/).

  * Try to estimate the time needed to study that chapter (using the pomodoro technique)
  * Answer (for example on the team's wiki pages)
    * What is analysis?
    * What is design?
    * What's the difference between them?
    * What is design for?
      * in other words, how would you reply to the following statement: _"I just need to understand what to do (analysis) and then do it (coding). Everything else does not matter!"_
