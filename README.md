# Starway to Orione DoAI

DoAI is the **D**evelopment **O**peration and **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence

## Machine Learning

This is the learning path every new cloud data engineer has to follow when joining the XPeppers Cloud team.
This path reflects our team's culture and values, which have their roots in the [agile values and principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/).

Please feel free to fork and contribute, add materials, fix the existing ones and propose new stuff.

During all the plan read [The Phoenix Project](https://books.google.it/books/about/The_Phoenix_Project.html?id=qaRODgAAQBAJ).


## Main learning path

### 1) Methodology
* Flat Organizations:
   * [The Flat Way](https://link.medium.com/E4kjMXajO3) ```#onboarding```
   * [Teal Is The New Black: Self-management and the future of work](https://management30.com/blog/teal-organization-self-management-future-of-work/)
   * [Collaborative decision making in self-organizing teams](https://www.agilebusinessday.com/2019/09/26/collaborative-decision-making-in-self-organizing-teams-abd19-lorenzo-massacci/)
* Read chapters 1, 4, 5, 7 of [XP Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416) ```#onboarding```
* Read chapters 2, 6 of [XP Explained](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416)
* Iterative and Incremental Development:
  * [Waterfall](https://condor.depaul.edu/dmumaugh/readings/handouts/IS375/IIDI.pdf) ```#onboarding```
  * [Agile](https://condor.depaul.edu/dmumaugh/readings/handouts/IS375/IIDII.pdf) ```#onboarding```
  * [Transition](https://condor.depaul.edu/dmumaugh/readings/handouts/IS375/IIDIII.pdf) 
* For __italian speakers__, Watch ["Perché è così difficile fare Extreme Programming"](https://vimeo.com/113090009) by Matteo Vaccari ```#onboarding```
* [Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html) ```#onboarding```
* Agile Mindset:
   * [What Exactly is the Agile Mindset?](https://www.infoq.com/articles/what-agile-mindset/) ```#onboarding```
* Read [The Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) paper
* Read first chapter of ["Applying UML and Patterns"](http://www.amazon.com/Applying-UML-Patterns-Introduction-Object-Oriented/dp/0131489062)
  * Try to estimate the time needed to study that chapter (using the pomodoro technique)
  * Answer (for example on the team's wiki pages)
    * What is analysis?
    * What is design?
    * What's the difference between them?
    * What is design for?
      * in other words, how would you reply to the following statement: _"I just need to understand what to do (analysis) and then do it (coding). Everything else does not matter!"_
